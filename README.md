# GraphBepi-Notebook
An attempt to recreate the results reported [here](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/4/btad187/7114029). <br>
Most of the code comes from [the original repo](https://github.com/biomed-AI/GraphBepi) with a few changes. <br>
Recommended versions for torch and pytorch-lightning are respectively 1.12.1 and 1.6.4. <br>
(The current notebook has only been trained for 30 epochs, to achieve results similar to the ones reported in the paper, 300 epochs are needed.)
