# GraphBepi-Notebook
(A work in progress)
An attempt to recreate the results reported [here](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/4/btad187/7114029).
Most of the code comes from [the original repo](https://github.com/biomed-AI/GraphBepi) with a few changes.
Recommended versions for torch and pytorch-lightning are respectively 1.12.1 and 1.6.4.
